- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dwaineeck
- 👀 I’m interested in developing the world, and saying 'Hello, New World', on another planet, galaxy, and universe.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I cannot stop dreaming for a better planet by being silent. Technology will continue our search for the greatest way to bring peace to our universe.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development that makes the world a better place.
